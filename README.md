# Pokemon-TCG-Checklist-Generator
Quick little script that outputs A4 sized pages of checklists ready for printing for your Pokemon TCG Collection.

Check out the repo then run a http server (e.g. python: `python -m http.server 8000`), open the index file, let Vue process the data and then Ctrl+P to print to PDF or your printer :)

Change what gets rendered with the dropdown, as core sets and expansions separated from Promos and such, then anything double sided or greater is on the "super" dropdown.
