# Pokemon-TCG-Checklist-Generator
Quick little script that outputs A4 sized pages of checklists ready for printing for your Pokemon TCG Collection, mimicking the style of the official checklists

Checkout the repo then run a http server (e.g. python: `python -m http.server 8000`), open the index file, let Vue process the data and then Ctrl+P to print to PDF or your printer :)

Change what gets displayed with the dropdown:
- Core sets and expansions.
- Promos, extras and such.
- Anything double sided or greater.
